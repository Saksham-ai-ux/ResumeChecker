# Automated Resume Relevance Check System

ðŸš€ **Resume Relevance Checker MVP**

---

## Problem Statement

At Innomatics Research Labs, resume evaluation is manual, inconsistent, and slow, impacting the placement process. The goal is to automate resume evaluation at scale, generate relevance scores, highlight gaps, and provide actionable feedback to students. This system speeds up shortlisting and aids placement teams by offering consistent, AI-driven resume analysis against job descriptions.

---

## Approach

This MVP uses a hybrid AI approach:

- **Hard Match:** Keyword and skill matching between resumes and job descriptions.
- **Semantic Match:** Embeddings and large language models (LLMs) for contextual understanding.
- Combines scores for an overall relevance rating (0-100).
- Provides verdicts (High/Medium/Low) and missing skills/projects.
- Built with Python, Streamlit (for UI), LangChain, and LLM APIs.
- Fast resume parsing using PyMuPDF and python-docx.
- Results presented in a user-friendly web app dashboard for placement teams.
